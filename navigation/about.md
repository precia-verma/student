# 🌟 Blog/Retrospective 🌟

**My Computer Science Journey This Year**

---

## 📊 Then vs. Now: My Growth Journey

### 🌱 Beginning of the Year
- Basic understanding of coding (I only knew what block coding was)
- Limited knowledge
- Unfamiliar with VSCode
- No experience with GitHub
- Struggled with debugging
- Worked mostly independently

### 🚀 Now
- Good web development skills
- Proficient in JavaScript and Python
- Confident using Git/GitHub workflows
- Used AI to better help with my coding journey
- Developed strong debugging skills
- Effective team collaborator

## 🎯 Key Learnings from 3 Sprints

### Sprint 1: Tools & Setup 🛠️

**What I Learned:**
- Setting up development environment with VSCode
- Using terminal commands
- How to sync GitHub repositories and VSCode
- File navigation
- Markdown for documentation

**Key Takeaway:** Having the right tools and knowing how to use them is the base of good development.

### Sprint 2: Fundamentals of JavaScript 💻

[Boolean Lesson](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/javascript/boolean-blog)

[Array Lesson](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/javascript/array/lesson)

**What I Learned:**
- JavaScript syntax, variables, and data types
- Functions, loops, and conditionals
- DOM manipulation
- Arrays, objects, and data structures
- Debugging with console.log and browser dev tools

**Key Takeaway:** JavaScript is wonderful for creating websites and understanding its usage opened up endless possibilities.

**Boolean and Array Presentation:** I believe that we did excellent with our Boolean presentation, but not as great with our Array presentation. Out group faced one of the biggest and most feared challenge right before our presentation, which was that our code wasn't functioning the way we wanted it to. We faced a lot of struggles and obstacles but at the end we were able to present with what we had and accepted our grade, focusing on what to do next and a postive midset for the future ahead.

### Sprint 3: Quest of Spook - Gamify 🎮

[Mansion Level 2 Game](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/gamify/mansion2)

**What I Learned:**
- Game logic and state management
- User interaction and experience design
- Working with javascript for a game and using markdown along with a javascript file as well. 
- Creating engaging visual designs
- Team collaboration on a complex project

**Key Takeaway:** Gamification makes learning fun and applying concepts in a game context helped solidify my understanding of programming concepts.

## 🎪 Night at the Museum (N@tM) Experience

### How It Went

N@tM was an incredible experience! Presenting our Level 2 Mansion game to visitors, parents, and CSA/CSP people was both nerve-wracking and exciting. Seeing and few people actually play and also enjoy what we created was incredibly rewarding.

**Highlights:**
- Had over 10+ people try/see our game
- Received positive feedback on the memory game
- Got to see other amazing projects from other classes
- Learned presentation and communication skills
- Felt proud of our team's accomplishment

## 🔮 Future Plans & Goals

### What I Want to Do Next on the Project (Given Time)

**Short-term (1-2 weeks):**
- Add sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience
- Implement a hints system for players who get stuck on puzzles
- Fix any remaining bugs and polish up the game

**Medium-term (3-4 weeks):**
- Create 2-3 additional levels with increasing difficulty
- Add a timer feature and scoring system to make it more competitive
- Develop a leaderboard to track top players

**Long-term (1-2 months):**
- Implement a multiplayer mode where friends can collaborate on puzzles
- Create a level editor tool that would allow players to build their own custom mansion rooms by choosing puzzle types, setting difficulty, and arranging room layouts - then save and share their creations with other players
- Add different difficulty modes (easy, medium, hard)

### What I Want to Learn Next in CompSci
- **Backend development** - Learning how to build the "behind-the-scenes" parts of websites that store and manage user data (like login systems and databases)
- **Machine Learning/AI basics** - Understanding how computers can learn patterns and make predictions (like recommendation systems on Netflix or Spotify)
- **Mobile app development** - Creating apps for phones instead of just websites
- **Cybersecurity** - Learning how to protect websites and data from hackers
- **Better problem-solving skills** - Getting faster at figuring out coding challenges and writing cleaner code
- **Own Game/Website** - I want to learn how to make my own website/game without using Mr.Mortensen's repository.

## ✨ Something Cool I Want to Share ✨

### The Coding Community is Really Nice

I used to think programmers worked alone and never talked to anyone (like in movies). But that's totally wrong! **Everyone helps each other out.** My classmates text me back late at night when I'm stuck. People from other advanced classes like CSP/CSA help me when im stuck at Office Hours, like Vibha or anyone else avalible. People WANT you to succeed! It's like having a whole team cheering you on. That's what makes learning Computer Science so much fun - you're never alone!
