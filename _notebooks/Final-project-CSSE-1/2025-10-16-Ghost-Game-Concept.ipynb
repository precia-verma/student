    "*In a crumbling gothic mansion shrouded by fog and regret, a man flees in the dead of night for reasons even he can't fully explain. He leaves behind his greatest love — a woman whose heart once mirrored his own. Years later, guilt drags him back to the decaying halls of the estate… only to discover the horrifying truth: she's dead.*\n",

If he can locate her scattered bones hidden across the mansion's cursed grounds, he can perform a ritual to bring her back to life. Desperate and haunted, he agrees.*\n",
