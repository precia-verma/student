    "<p class=\"spooky-text\">In a crumbling gothic mansion shrouded by fog and regret, a man flees in the dead of night for reasons even he can’t fully explain. He leaves behind his greatest love — a woman whose heart once mirrored his own. Years later, guilt drags him back to the decaying halls of the estate… only to discover the horrifying truth: she’s dead.</p>\n",

Each discovery drags him deeper into obsession and madness. Reality begins to blur — is he seeing ghosts, or just his own guilt? The line between love and lunacy fades fast.</p>\n",

    "His mind had shattered from jealousy and rage, forcing him to flee and forget. The ghost was never real… just the echo of his guilt. As the truth consumes him, he performs the ritual anyway — but instead of resurrecting her, he becomes trapped in his own nightmare, drowning in grief and eternal sorrow.</p>\n",
