### <span style="color:#aa0000; font-family:'Times New Roman', serif; font-variant:small-caps;">� Backstory</span>

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7); border-left: 3px solid #800000; padding: 10px; font-style: italic; color: #cc0000;">
In a <b>crumbling gothic mansion</b> where shadows move of their own accord and walls whisper forgotten sins, a man flees in the dead of night, his hands stained with what he refuses to remember. He leaves behind his greatest love — a woman whose heart once mirrored his own. Years later, guilt drags him back to the decaying halls of the estate… only to discover the <b>horrifying truth</b>: she's dead, her corpse preserved in a grotesque tableau, as if waiting for his return.

### <span style="color:#aa0000; font-family:'Times New Roman', serif; font-variant:small-caps;">👻 Act 1: The Vengeful Spirit</span>

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7); border-left: 3px solid #800000; padding: 10px; font-style: italic; color: #cc0000;">
One <b>violent, storm-wracked night</b>, her ghost appears before him — her form distorted, flesh peeling from bone, eyes hollow yet somehow filled with malice. She speaks with a voice that echoes from both everywhere and nowhere. Her spirit is trapped in torment, she claims, unable to find rest. If he can locate her <b>scattered, mutilated remains</b> hidden throughout the mansion's cursed grounds, he can perform a ritual to bring her back to life. Desperate and haunted, he agrees, unaware of the <b>blood pact</b> he has just entered.

### <span style="color:#aa0000; font-family:'Times New Roman', serif; font-variant:small-caps;">🔍 Act 2: Descent Into Madness</span>

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7); border-left: 3px solid #800000; padding: 10px; font-style: italic; color: #cc0000;">
The mansion transforms into his personal hell, a <b>labyrinth of nightmares</b> that shifts and changes when he isn't looking. As he hunts for the remains, he uncovers blood-soaked letters, viscera-stained heirlooms, and eerie remnants of their twisted past. Each discovery drags him deeper into <b>obsession and insanity</b>. Hideous apparitions stalk him through the halls. The walls weep blood. Reality fractures like broken glass — is he seeing ghosts, or just manifestations of his own <b>unforgivable sins</b>? The line between reality and nightmare dissolves in a pool of crimson.

### <span style="color:#aa0000; font-family:'Times New Roman', serif; font-variant:small-caps;">😱 Act 3: The Horrifying Truth</span>

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7); border-left: 3px solid #800000; padding: 10px; font-style: italic; color: #cc0000;">
In the final act, as thunder splits the sky and <b>unholy whispers</b> fill his ears, the truth emerges like maggots from rotting flesh — <b>he was the one who killed her</b>. His mind had shattered from jealousy and rage, his hands becoming instruments of brutal murder, forcing him to flee and bury the memories. The ghost was never real… just the <b>echo of his guilt and madness</b>. As the truth consumes him like ravenous insects beneath his skin, he performs the ritual anyway — but instead of resurrecting her, he becomes trapped in his own personal hell, an eternity of <b>torturous grief where her partially reconstructed corpse becomes his eternal judge, jury, and tormentor</b>.

## <span style="color:#aa0000; font-family:'Courier New', monospace;">💌 Sample In-Game Letter</span>

<div class="letter-container">
<h4 style="color: #aa0000; text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Found nailed to a door, written in what appears to be blood...</h4>

<blockquote style="border-left: none; font-style: italic; color: #990000; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">
<p><b>My Dearest Irene,</b></p>

<p>If you are reading this, then the darkness has already consumed me.<br>
Please understand that I did not leave you out of hatred, but because something inside me has <b>AWAKENED</b>.</p>

<p>Something <b>ANCIENT AND HUNGRY</b> now whispers when the house sleeps, a shadow that follows me even in blinding light. I see it in the mirror—where my reflection should be, there stands a <b>THING WEARING MY SKIN POORLY</b>. I can no longer trust what I see, what I touch, what I remember.</p>

<p>I beg of you, <b>STAY AWAY</b> from the east wing. The floorboards there are stained with secrets that must remain buried. Do not search for me, no matter what sounds like my voice calls to you in the night. If I ever loved you—and by all that is unholy, I did—you must promise me that.</p>

<p>Your name will be carved into my flesh until the end of my days.<br>
And perhaps, when this curse has feasted fully, I will find what remains of you.</p>

<p><b>Forever yours in blood and bone,</b><br>
<b>Earnest</b></p>
</blockquote>

## <span style="color:#aa0000; font-family:'Courier New', monospace;">🎭 Why This Nightmare?</span>

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7); border-left: 3px solid #800000; padding: 10px; font-style: italic; color: #cc0000;">
This horror experience explores the darkest corners of the human psyche, where love warps into <b>obsession</b>, guilt manifests as <b>supernatural torment</b>, and the mind creates its own personal hell. It challenges players to confront unspeakable truths while being pursued by entities born from their own fractured psyche, all while immersed in a world where reality and nightmare have become indistinguishable.
