# üåä Aquatic Ecosystems

Aquatic ecosystems are environments dominated by water where organisms have evolved amazing adaptations to survive and thrive.

## What are Aquatic Ecosystems?

Aquatic ecosystems include all water-based environments on Earth, from vast oceans to small ponds. These systems are characterized by:

- **Water as the primary medium** for life
- **Unique physical properties** like buoyancy and pressure
- **Light penetration** that decreases with depth
- **Dissolved oxygen** and nutrient levels

## Types of Aquatic Ecosystems

### Marine Ecosystems
- **Oceans**: Open water with high salinity
- **Coral Reefs**: Biodiversity hotspots in warm, shallow waters
- **Estuaries**: Where rivers meet the sea, creating brackish water

### Freshwater Ecosystems
- **Rivers and Streams**: Flowing water systems
- **Lakes and Ponds**: Standing water bodies
- **Wetlands**: Marshy areas that filter water naturally

## Adaptations

Aquatic organisms have developed remarkable adaptations:

- **Gills** for extracting oxygen from water
- **Streamlined bodies** for efficient swimming
- **Swim bladders** for buoyancy control
- **Specialized feeding** structures for filter feeding or predation

## Food Chains

Aquatic food chains often start with:
1. **Phytoplankton** (primary producers)
2. **Zooplankton** (primary consumers)
3. **Small fish** (secondary consumers)
4. **Large fish/marine mammals** (tertiary consumers)
