# üå≤ Terrestrial Ecosystems

Terrestrial ecosystems are land-based communities where organisms have adapted to life without the support and protection of water.

## What are Terrestrial Ecosystems?

Terrestrial ecosystems are shaped by:

- **Climate patterns** (temperature and precipitation)
- **Soil composition** and depth
- **Topography** (mountains, plains, valleys)
- **Seasonal changes** in many regions

## Major Types

### Forests
- **Tropical Rainforests**: High biodiversity, warm year-round
- **Temperate Deciduous**: Seasonal leaf changes
- **Coniferous/Boreal**: Evergreen trees, cold winters

### Grasslands
- **Prairies**: Temperate grasslands with rich soils
- **Savannas**: Tropical grasslands with scattered trees

### Deserts
- **Hot Deserts**: Extreme heat, minimal rainfall
- **Cold Deserts**: Cold winters, low precipitation

### Tundra
- **Arctic conditions** with permafrost
- **Limited growing season**

## Adaptations

Land organisms have evolved various strategies:

- **Water conservation** (waxy leaves, efficient kidneys)
- **Temperature regulation** (fur, behavioral changes)
- **Support structures** (strong stems, skeletons)
- **Reproduction** strategies for dry conditions

## Plant Adaptations
- **Root systems** for water and nutrient uptake
- **Leaf modifications** to reduce water loss
- **Seasonal timing** for growth and reproduction

## Animal Adaptations
- **Migration** patterns following resources
- **Hibernation** to survive harsh seasons
- **Camouflage** for predator avoidance
- **Social behaviors** for protection and resource sharing
